## Coding Standards
also known as coding conventions, are a set of agreed-upon rules that developers follow to ensure the reusability, efficiency and readability of the written code. These rules or conventions often cover the organization, indentation, comments, declarations, statements, white space, naming conventions, programming practices, programming principles, programming rules of thumb, architectural best practices, etc.
As it is stated previously in this documentation, the main 3 programming languages/ frameworks we are using for this project are Laravel, React and Flutter. We have listed below the coding standards used for each of these languages/ frameworks with their brief description.

# 1. Node: 
    The coding standard used for our Node JS implementation adopts most of the common
    best practices in the programming world and it follows a pattern developed for this project so as to ease the development process.
# 2. React:
    the coding standard used for React is React coding Standards and Practices used in the programming world and it follows a pattern developed for ease development process.
    Those are:
    i.	React UI componentâ€™s names should be PascalCase.
    ii.	All other helper files should be camelCase. (non-component files)
    iii.	All the folder names should be camelCase. Example: components
    iv.	CSS files should be named the same as the component PascalCase. Global CSS which applies to all components should be placed in global.css and should be named in camelCase.
    v.	CSS class names should use a standard naming convention (personally use kebab-case because it's used by most of the CSS framework classes) or any standard practice. 
    vi.	Test files should be named the same as the component or non-component file.

# 3. Flutter:
    The Coding Standard for Flutter describes the developer's approach to designing and programming Flutter, from high-level architectural principles all the way to indentation rules. In the words of the developers themselves, "Write what you need and no more, but when you write it, do it right". Although the coding standard for Flutter and Dart are different, the document outlining the coding standard of flutter explicitly states the differences and recommends the user to look at the coding standard of Dart for further clarification on certain similar aspects.
